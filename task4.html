        <h1>Thrift fashion</h1>
        <p style = "color:red;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The fast fashion industry has always been associated with large scale pollution and a host of other issues. Finding alternate means to lengthen the lifecycle of clothes by turning towards sustainable fashion, has become an absolute necessity in current times and this can be achieved with thrifting--a new concept of buying second-hand clothing.</p>
        <p style = "font-size: 30px;">sustainable fashion has emerged as the antidote to harmful fast fashion practices. Kate Fletcher, author and design activist, defines sustainable fashion as "fashion that fosters ecological integrity and social justice".</p>
