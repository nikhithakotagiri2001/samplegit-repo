        <h1>Thrift fashion</h1>
        <p style= "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">The fast fashion industry has always been associated with large scale pollution and a host of other issues. Finding alternate means to lengthen the lifecycle of clothes by turning towards sustainable fashion, has become an absolute necessity in current times and this can be achieved with thrifting--a new concept of buying second-hand clothing.</p>

            Considering the current state of online thrifting, it is clear that the thrift culture has undoubtedly captivated the interest of the youth.
            Despite being limited to a small online community in India, thrift culture has maintained a growing presence over the last few years. 
            Only time will tell whether the thrift culture among the youth is a passing trend that will soon blow over or if it is a phenomenon that is here to stay.
